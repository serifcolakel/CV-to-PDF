        "summary": "I am a graduate of FÄ±rat University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am also a Double Major student in Computer Engineering. I've been a front-end developer for 1 year. I am trying to develop projects by using ReactJS, NextJS, HTML, CSS, SASS, Tailwind, Styled Component, React Native and TypeScript / JavaScript languages effectively and following the agenda. I'm also trying to learn backend paradigms with NodeJS (Express / Prisma / MySQL / PostgreSQL). In addition, in my last work experience, I tried to automate the build processes on the server using technologies such as pm2 / Nginx / jenkins. This was also a good experience for me."
