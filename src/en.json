        "summary": "As a graduation project, during my internship at Isdemir, I had the opportunity to examine the quality control and identity of the steel in the steel production of Parstech, which is formed according to certain conditions, and the detection of the deterioration caused by the production errors that occur during the production by using image processing method and recording it on the determined identity is evaluated according to customer requests. We carried out the project on the development of the project under the consultancy of Prof.Dr.Abdulkadir Şengür. Also, I am still developing myself on these issues. I have been developing myself and producing projects in the front-end field for about 6 months in order to develop my interest in software in different fields. You can access the details of the projects on my github page."
